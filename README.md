# AntiDiscrete

This program created to solve home task in Mr. Avdoshin's Discrete Math course.

I think, only stupid people cannot use this program without readme, so they must be expelled from HSE.
This is the main reason, why this readme so isn't informative.

You need to check, that files Basises.res and Functions.res must be in .exe file directory.
